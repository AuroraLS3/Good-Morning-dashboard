# Good Morning -dashboard

This is a personal dashboard that I run on a wall-mounted phone I stopped using after the battery-life became extremely unrealiable. The phone is always plugged-in to the charger.

I use this dashboard in addition to a whiteboard. Anything that keeps getting constantly rewritten on the board shall be turned virtual.

Features

- A checkbox list for recurring things like exercise routine, medicine and other stuff
- A days-to-date counter that counts down each day.
- Edit mode for the two items to add more counters or checkboxes
